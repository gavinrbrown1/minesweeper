# Minesweeper Player

A minesweeper player in the command line, still very much in progress.

Currently the game plays about as well as I do:
1. Find the places that are definitely bombs
2. Find the places that are definitely not bombs
3. Panic if I have to do any reasoning and just click somewhere

To run the game, just `python3 run.py`.
